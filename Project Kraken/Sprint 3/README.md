# Sprint 3
Updated on 5/3/22

## Introduction

During this sprint we intended to implement alpha versions of our scripts for both Augur and Augur View.  However, due to whatever reason only one group member successfully finished their tasks for this sprint.  This resulted in one of four scripts being published this sprint.

## Issues

The main issue with this sprint was communication and effort.  The majority of the team failed to finish their designated tasks, as well as didn't report on this failure.  A side issue was learning how to properly develop bash scripts for the dependency installer script though that just took some time to learn the language.

## Reflection

This sprint we discovered that it is beneficial to finish our designated tasks.  It also should the importance of communication since not communicating with our groupmates may cause misunderstandings.

## Goals

Hopefully, during this upcoming sprint we will do a better job a coordinating and contributing to the project.  Ideally, everyone finishes their tasks and we submit a ready to deploy addition to Augur.
