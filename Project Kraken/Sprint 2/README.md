# Sprint 2

## Introduction

For this sprint, we created a design document to layout the requirements we intend to implement over the course of this project.  The design document includes 4 diagrams with a small description for each one and can be found [here](./design_document.md).  We also included a small demo of a portion of our script.  This was included to demonstrate we understand the layout of the repository and what will be required to implement our requirements.  No updates were made to the Sprint 1 requirements since we submitted it last minute and have not gotten feedback yet.

## Issues

We didn't encounter any technical issues during this sprint.  We struggled a little to catch up with the project schedule since we fell behind in sprint 1, but we completed everything else with minor difficulties.

## Reflection

After experiencing being behind, it became even more apparent that we need to stay on top of our project.  If this sprint required more work, then we may have been a little stressed.  Since the sprint didn't require too much, we managed to complete it on time.  

## Goals

Our goals again this week are to keep each other accountable and stay committed to the sprint.  Our consistent tardiness will cause issues in the upcoming sprints, so this must be fixed too.
