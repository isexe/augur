# Sprint 1
For this sprint, we deployed an Augur server and documented the requirements for our project.  The deployed server's API endpoint can be found [here](http://kraken-augur.centralus.cloudapp.azure.com:5000/api/unstable/).  For our project, we will be working on Augur and Augur View by improving upon their installation processes and revising their installation documentation.  The requirements for Augur can be found [here](/Sprint1%20Documentation/augur_requirements.pdf) and its use case can be found [here](/Sprint1%20Documentation/augur_use-case.md).  The requirements document for Augur View can be found [here](/Sprint1%20Documentation/augur-view_requirements.docx) and its use case can be found [here](/Sprint1%20Documentation/augur-view_use-case.pdf).
