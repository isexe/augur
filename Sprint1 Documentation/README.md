# Sprint 1
## Introduction
For this sprint, we deployed an Augur server and documented the requirements for our project.  The deployed server's API endpoint can be found [here](http://kraken-augur.centralus.cloudapp.azure.com:5000/api/unstable/).  For our project, we will be working on Augur and Augur View by improving upon their installation processes and revising their installation documentation.  The requirements for Augur can be found [here](/Sprint1%20Documentation/augur_requirements.pdf) and its use case can be found [here](/Sprint1%20Documentation/augur_use-case.md).  The requirements document for Augur View can be found [here](/Sprint1%20Documentation/augur-view_requirements.docx) and its use case can be found [here](/Sprint1%20Documentation/augur-view_use-case.pdf).

## Issues
We didn't encounter too many issues as this sprint was mainly just figuring out what we were going to focus on during our project and the requirements documentation.  We had some initial problems with setting up the Augur server, but after some troubleshooting and research, we were able to resolve the majority of these issues.  We also had some communication issues as the project started, but that is to be expected when working with a new team of peers and will most likely be mitigated by the end of the project.

## Reflection
While working on this sprint, we had some troubles with our initial project requirements.  We originally had planned on doing a project on just the installation of Augur and updating its documentation.  Although after our team meeting with Professor Goggins, we were reminded that this project should include enough work for all of our team members.  This reminded us that the scope of this project is quite large and that falling behind will inevitably lead to issues later, so being diligent will be necessary.

## Goals
Since we've already fallen slightly behind on this first sprint, we want to focus on staying on top of our work and spreading out the workload of each sprint over the entire week.  We also plan on having team meetings to discuss topics of each sprint and other concerns of the project.  We feel that our primary goal is to have this project be a simulation of a work environment that uses SCRUM and that we will prioritize properly following this management technique to complete this project.
