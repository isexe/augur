### Introduction

This folder contains the files that are used for the 'make easy-install' command.  Currently, the command isn't functional and throws an error due to an error during the installation of one of the workers.  This error seems to originate for outside of these scripts, but there could just be something wrong in the [installer script](./Installer.sh).

If there is ever a change to the required packages for Augur please amend them to the dependancy array [here](./dependency_installer.sh).
